{"name":"Franco Berton","tagline":"","body":"## About me\r\n\r\n![](https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15656988?v=3&s=460)\r\n\r\nFranco Berton is an italian computer programmer. Currently, I'm about to graduate in computer science at University of Padua.\r\nMy innate passion for the computer science, in particular for the programming, born because I've always had interest to know how the code become a program. \r\nOver all these years of study, I realized how important the ground rules of software development are. \r\nReliability, extensibility,legibility and recycling are 4 basic aspects to develope a qualitative software.\r\nIn my opinion,the computer programmer isn't a job where we have to have the ability to just program, but we must have a futuristic vision of market and development of information technologies. \r\nMy passion and my dedication try to pass it to all,trying everyday to learn new technologies to improve in my projects. \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
